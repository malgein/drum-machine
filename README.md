This projects it was'nt mine, but I can do it for myself, because i can make it for my own , this is from another user.

this ilustrate the basic thigns of react.js like : useState, useEffect and more 

this prject consist in app of sounds like piano and drums with  the users clics somes button, that is the interesting of the app this projects has event listener like keydowns, on clicks, on changes, has a recording of sounds that was clicked, an input of volume, and speed and an efect of color when you click a button.

looks easy but it is not, and I think this projects made it for someone shows that he has the abilities necesary to work with react.js.
